Boxstarter scripts to setup a dev environment on a new windows box.

## Goal:

- Keep it lean
- Keep it simple

There is a two step process, some large installs like VS, SQL server etc.. are done manually.


## Notes:

- The boxstarter list only containts software I use regularly. Nothing more.
- The boxstarter links to use in IE are found at the top of each file.
- The order in which the files should be run are:
    1. UpdateWindows.txt (Run this just after installing windows.)
    1. InstallSotware.txt
    1. PostInstall.txt

- ConEmu can be set to replace cmd.exe, which I highly recommend. http://superuser.com/questions/509642/how-to-change-the-default-terminal-emulator-on-windows-cmd/509710#509710
  (If you are not sure about ConEmu then read this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60950/is-there-a-better-windows-console-window/10904494#10904494)
- Notepad2-mod can be set to replace notepad. http://www.flos-freeware.ch/doc/notepad2-Replacement.html
  Notpead2-mod is a very capable editor, and opens up files realy fast.
